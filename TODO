- try reduce benchmark
- remove default scheduler method and default drive
- panic on with_producer if we can only be a consumer
- clippy
- are we are going to have a problem with current reducer:
    ---> if we flat_map and inside the second level we have an adaptive sched
    then the reducer needs to do a partial fold
    ---> I guess we need the partial_fold to be inside the reducer
